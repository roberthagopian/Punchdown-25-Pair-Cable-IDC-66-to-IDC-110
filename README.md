<h2>Punchdwon 25-Pair</h2>
25-Pair cable is mostly used in various parts of buildings where low-speed data circuit demands are present. the focus of this lab was to learn the skills of quickly, safely, neatly punching down 25-Pair. This was my first time learning the color code for 25-pair as well.

Over on the 110 side, which is the Telcom industry standard, offering much higher data transfer rates than the 66 block. I'll also add that the termination process was much faster.
